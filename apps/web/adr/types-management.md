# ADR: Types Management

## Decision

We propose the following Types structure for the NextJS project:

1. Types of our app: Inside the `types` folder in the root directory of the project we will have the models that we use in the app.

2. Types of the APIs: Inside the `types` folder, inside a separate folder for each API we consume, we will have the DTOs from the API.
